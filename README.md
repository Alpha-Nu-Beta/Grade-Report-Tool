# Troubleshooting
* If you are wanting to upload the report to Google Drive, you **MUST** have a credentials and token file in the root of the project directory.
  * Download [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FItTRjHu6cLKdr4TJ4NdyTplSwSsNvzB/view?usp=sharing) file and place it in the root of the project. Run the code and when you agree to upload to drive, it'll open a window and ask you to sign in. This must be using a Hutt account, not personal.
